          <h1>FAULTS AND ALTERNATIVES</h1>
          <p>The backlog caused by the excessive number of cancellations in such a short period of time this is the reason why agents struggle to meet deadlines.
          
            A way to fix the backlog would be to separate the older queries from the new queries then the work can be spilt so that some agents work on newer queries and the others work on the older ones.

          The map on site is not as accurate so they can use Gemini's way of seeing coverage  on the map to deter the cancelations of network.</p>

        <div class="continue">
          <p>To decrease the amount of backlog, the system could filter out the cancellations of users that have overdue accounts to billing instead of retentions then billing could send information to help the customer with their billing. This will increase the amount of time that retentions could be used on other queries. 
  
            Another way to decrease backlog is by adding a function that can be added to the system that will allow the agents to choose the template for a specific query that will automatically add the email to the dashboard with the information of the user that can still be edited. Already in use but most agents don't use it.

          <h1>COSTUMER SERVICE</h1>
          <p>Calls can be missed when an agent reschedules a call with a customer so adding a function to the system that will set a reminder for the agent instead of them having to use other methods. 

            Make the system user friendly for agents so that they understand the system quicker and can adapt easily . 
            
            Sending SMSs to a customer if/when the tower goes down will lessen the chance of the customer cancelling or calling in to complain.
            
            They can have weekly training session that will help them cope with stress and help them better the work. Boosting confidence and helping with mental stress.

          <h1>TICKETING SYSYTEM</h1>
          <p>For the Sales Department, the tickets are not assigned to an agent they need to access the ticket and try to call the client. Then if/when the sales rep gets the call, they need to add an internal note to tell other sale reps that they on call. If that was automated, it would make it easier for the sales rep to get a ticket and get a customer to buy a product.</p>
